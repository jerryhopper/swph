######## VARIABLES #########
# For better maintainability, we store as much information that can change in variables
# This allows us to make a change in one place that can propagate to all instances of the variable
# These variables should all be GLOBAL variables, written in CAPS
# Local variables will be in lowercase and will exist only within functions
# It's still a work in progress, so you may see some variance in this guideline until it is complete
